@* TODO Every user has their own personal page, where they can manage two sortable/filterable tables: *@
@* A table of inventories they own (with options to create new, delete, or edit). *@
@* A table of inventories they have write access to. *@
@* *@
@* Each inventory in the table functions as a link to its dedicated page, which contains several tabs: *@
@* Table of items in the inventory (with links to individual item pages). *@
@* Discusison section. *@
@* General settings — title, description, etc. *@
@* Custom inventory numbers. *@
@* Access settings — either all authenticated users (for public inventories) or specific users (for non-public ones). *@
@* Editable set of fields for all items in the inventory. *@
@* Inventory statistics/aggregation, such as the number of items, averages and ranges for numeric fields, most frequently used values for string fields, etc. The owner doesn't edit anything on this tab. *@
@* *@
@* For users with write access (but not ownership), only the 1st and 2nd tabs are accessible in edit mode (items). *@
@* *@
@* The inventory author and users with write access can: *@
@* Click any item to open it in edit mode. *@
@* Delete existing items. *@
@* Add new items. *@
